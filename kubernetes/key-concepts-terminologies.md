### Cluster Architecture

The architectural concepts behind Kubernetes

### Containers

### Policy

### Scheduling, Preemption and Eviction

In K8S, scheduling refers to making sure that Pods are matched to Nodes so that the kubelet can run them. Preemption is the process of terminating Pods with lower Priority so that  Pods with higher Priority can schedule on Nodes. Eviction is the process of proactively one or more Pods on resource-starved Nodes.
