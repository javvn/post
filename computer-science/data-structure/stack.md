Stack is a linear collection of items where items are inserted and removed in a particular order. 
Stack is also called a LIFO abstract data structure because it follows the “Last In First Out” principle i.e the item that is inserted in the last is the one that is taken out first. This really useful for lots and lots of things, where you need to be keep track of what has happened in this particular order.

# Summary

- Stacks can be implemented with either an array a linked list
- Each stack operation is O(1) : Push, Pop, Top, Empty
- Stacks are ocassionaly known as LIFO queues.
